The series follows three supporting characters from Only Fools and Horses; Boycie (John Challis), his wife Marlene (Sue Holderness) and their teenage son Tyler. The interaction between characters is essential and much is made of the character's individual traits, such as Boycie's arrogance, Elgin's dim-wit, Bryan and Jed's inepititude, Imelda's slacking work-ethic and Llewellyn's rivalry with Boycie. There are also several running gags, including Boycie's attempts to be a gentleman farmer and his yearning for respect which he never gets, Boycie's fear of the Driscoll brothers and Marlene's alleged sexual affair with a now-unseen Del Boy, and the fact that Tyler is possibly Del's son. The prequel was shelved and spin-off The Green Green Grass was then developed to follow secondary characters, Boycie, Marlene and their son Tyler as they escape the Driscoll brothers and attempt to live in the countryside of Shropshire. All three well-known actors played important roles in their individual episodes, either as the person who led the Driscoll Brothers to Boycie, the father of one of Boycie's staff or as a pain-in-the-backside mother-in-law.
