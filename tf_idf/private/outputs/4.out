When police tunics had closed collars (not open collars as worn with ties), constables and sergeants did not wear epaulettes but had their divisional call number on their collar (hence they are still often referred to as collar numbers). Ranks above chief superintendent are usually non-operational management roles, and are often referred to as "chief officer" ranks, but the longer phrase "chief police officer" or similar in legislation is specifically a commissioner or chief constable, a "senior police officer" being their immediate deputy. The Isle of Man police ranks follow the structure of other British police rank structures however it is notably missing the chief superintendent and assistant chief constable ranks within their own structure. In England and Wales, these include the powers to: authorise the continued detention of up to 24 hours of a person arrested for an offence and brought to a police station (granted to sergeants and above at designated police stations), authorise section 18 (1) PACE house searches (granted to inspectors and above), or extend the length of prisoner detention to 36 hours (granted to superintendents), extend the length of bail from a police station to three months (granted to superintendents).In relation to police officers of the Home Office or territorial police forces of England and Wales, section 30 of the Police Act 1996 states that "a member of a police force shall have all the powers and privileges of a Constable throughout England and Wales and the adjacent United Kingdom waters". Police community support officers, in general, do not have a rank system: their epaulettes simply bear the words "Police community support officer" and their shoulder number, or, in the Metropolitan Police, a borough identification code and shoulder number.
